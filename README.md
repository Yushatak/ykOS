ykOS - Yushatak's personal OS project

Build Notes:
The version of dd used in the batch file is from 
http://www.chrysocome.net/dd

Other versions of dd will not necessarily work, instead blanking out the 
floppy image and leaving only what we write (making most emulators choke 
on it).

All ASM in this project is Intel syntax, and all non-inline ASM is 
compiled with NASM.
