;This is the bootloader. It loads the specified number of sectors
;at 0x10000 then jumps to them.
;
;Memory Map
;0x0x00007000->0x00007C00 = Stack (growing downward)
;0x00000000->0x00007E00 = Bootloader (this code)
;0x00007E00->0x0000FFFF = Unused
;0x00010000->0x00010000 + Kernel Size = Kernel
;Notes
;- [es:bx] means (es*0x10)+bx
;- If the drive letter is wrong it will quite possibly freeze with one sector load 
;dot since it prints those before actually reading.
;- LBA sector numbers start at 0, CHS sector numbers start at 1.
